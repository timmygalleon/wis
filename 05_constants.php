    <h1>PHP History</h1>
    <p><?php
define("PHP_HISTORY", "PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language that was originally designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and has since evolved into a powerful server-side scripting language.

PHP originally stood for 'Personal Home Page,' but it now stands for 'PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor' (a recursive acronym). PHP is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choice for web developers around the world.

PHP has gone through several major versions, with PHP 7 being a significant milestone in terms of performance and features. It introduced features like scalar type declarations, return type declarations, and the spaceship operator (<=>), improving code quality and performance.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, PHP continues to be widely used for building web applications, and it has a strong community of developers and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.");
